Flash is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to facilitate and enhance the experience of sports enthusiasts and venue owners alike. By providing players with tools to connect, discover, and book local playgrounds and allowing playground owners to manage and promote their facilities, Flash aims to become the premier solution for sports networking and venue management. The platform includes player-to-player booking capabilities, robust search and filtering options, and a streamlined system for owners to create and control playground slots, ultimately fostering an interconnected and vibrant sports community.

## Purpose

The purpose of Flash is to serve as a unified platform that enhances accessibility, community building, and convenience for both sports players and playground owners. Flash tackles the everyday challenges players face in finding dedicated teammates, discovering suitable playgrounds, and coordinating local games while providing playground owners with tools to manage their facilities, increase visibility, and simplify the booking process. By fostering personalised connections, offering robust search and filtering functionalities, and creating a dynamic marketplace for sports facilities, our project aims to energise the sports community, encouraging active participation and promoting a connected social environment.
